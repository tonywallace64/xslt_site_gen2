XML Metadata
============
Xml files SHOULD include metadata such as:

Filename:
Author:
Purpose:
Schema:

This metadata can and should be enforced by schema.

Tool Support
============

Enforce schema checking using automated tools such as 
mad compile.  Need a command_line schema validation
tool.  PyXml is a possibility.  Also look at trang and
schematools.  

Module XML
==========

There is a need for a modular xml construction
where there is a document wrapper with the metadata
and some form of content inside, a bit like MIME in email
and HTML systems.
