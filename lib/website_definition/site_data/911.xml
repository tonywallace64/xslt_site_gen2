<h3>Psychological Operations.<h3>
<p>
PSYOP are essential to the success of PRC. For maxi-
mum effectiveness, a strong psychological operations effort is directed toward the
families of the insurgents and their popular support base. The PSYOP aspect of the
PRC program tries to make the imposition of control more palatable to the people
by relating the necessity of controls to their safety and well-being. PSYOP efforts
also try to create a favorable national or local government image and counter the ef-
fects of the insurgent propaganda effort.
