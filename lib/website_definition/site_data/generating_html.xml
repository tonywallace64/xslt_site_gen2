<xhtml:h2>Generating Html</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>Generating HTML in this way is problematic in that
the latest HTML 5 is <xhtml:em>not</xhtml:em> xml compatible. By default
XSLT will collapse a opening closing tag pair into a self closing
tag that will cause problems in HTML 5. When this causes problems
put an XML comment between them to keep them apart.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Xml include is used to copy pages into the XML dataset at
appropriate places.  As XSLT 1.0 does not have the ability
to save each page to a separate file, this is done by an external
script written in Erlang.  Any suitable language could be used
for this task.</xhtml:p>
