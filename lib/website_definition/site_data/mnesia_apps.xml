<xhtml:p>This page is an attempt to answer the question of how to deploy
and update applications which contain a mnesia database component.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>This is clearly a prerequisite to deploying and updating websites
containing dynamic content.  When mnesia starts, it attempts to load
a database from the location specified by the -menisa-dir argument
given when the erlang runtime system was started.  It clearly follows
that this location must be built into the start scripts used for
starting the system.  And these in turn must be supplied to the relx
build system through the relx configuration file.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>It follows from this also that installing and updating such a system
are two quite distinct operations.  During an install the schema must
be created, and during updates the schema must be updated.</xhtml:p>
